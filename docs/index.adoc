= Get started with Headless CMS
:toc: right
:experimental:

This guide provides a step-by-step hands on introduction to using Enonic XP in Headless CMS mode.

NOTE: This guide requires Enonic XP 7

== Introduction

Throughout this tutorial you will learn how to:

* create a new project using the "Headless Starter"
* install and use "Content Studio" for editing content
* customize your application with new content types
* reuse schemas across content types (horizontal inheritance)
* access and use the Headless API

NOTE: If you want to build traditional web pages. Check out the guide: https://developer.enonic.com/guides/my-first-site[My first site]. Don't forget. You can also serve headless content from traditional Enonic sites as well ;-).


== Headless Movie Database

In this guide, we are using the demo application https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/headless-movie-db[Headless Movie Data Base] aka HMDB as a template for our project. The app may also be installed to your XP installation directly from Enonic Market.

== Create project

NOTE: *Don't have Enonic CLI?* Visit the https://developer.enonic.com/start[Getting started guide] to install it before you continue.


Create your project by running the following command:

  enonic project create -r app-hmdb


== Project structure

In the selected folder, you should now have a project structure, looking something like this:

.Selected files from the project structure:
[source,files]
----
src/
 main/
  resources/
   import <1>
   site/ <2>
    content-types/ <3>
    x-data/ <4>
samples/ <5>
----

<1> Sample content for Headless Movie Database
<2> This is where CMS-specific functionality is placed
<3> Content Types are placed in this directory
<4> X-data enables editors to add additional fields to content across different content types
<5> Sample files that will be used in the tutorial


== Building and Deploying

To build and deploy the app, simply run this command:

  enonic project deploy

[NOTE]
====
To verify that your app started successfully, you should find an entry similar to this in the sandbox log:

  2019-04-09 13:40:40,765 INFO ... Application [com.example.myproject] installed successfully
====

[TIP]
====
For the purposes of this guide, we'll build and deploy our project manually for each step. If you want to redeploy changes automatically, you can either run in https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/apps/build-system#development_mode[development mode] (which will instantly pickup changes to your files), or use https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/apps/build-system#continuous_building[continuous build mode], which will compile and re-deploy the full application. Use the following commands respectively:

  enonic sandbox start --dev
 
  enonic project gradle deploy --continuous
====

== Content Studio

From the admin console (available on http://localhost:8080).

Launch `Content Studio` from the XP menu.

NOTE: *Missing Content Studio?* Open the `Applications` app, choose `Install` and find it in the list of apps that appear.


== Headless demo project

Your newly created app includes a sample dataset. When the application started, it automatically created a project called `Headless Demo` and imported the `HMDB` dataset into it.

Simply select this project when prompted, and you will see the demo content, similar to the screenshot below:

image::images/hmdb.png["Headless Movie Database", width="1022px"]


NOTE: *HMDB* is built from three different content types: `Person`, `Playlist` and `Movie`.
Each content type defines a specific form to edit and publish new items.

=== Person Content Type

Let's have a closer look at the content type "Person".
When creating or editing a Person content, this is what the form looks like in the Content Studio App:

image::images/person.png["Person Form", width="728px"]

The form definition comes from the project file `/src/main/resources/site/content-type/person/person.xml`.

=== eXtra Data

This form also has an additional step for "Social Media" as can be seen below:

image::images/some.png["Social Media form step", width="737px"]

This step is loaded from a so-called eXtra data file (x-data for short).
The file is located in `/src/main/resources/site/x-data/SoMe/SoMe.xml`

The benefit of x-data is that it can be re-used across different content types (even across different apps within the same site).


== Adding a custom content type

To make things even more interesting, we can extend the project with a new content type for reviews.

[cols="1%s,99%a"]
[frame="none"]
[grid="none"]
|============================
|1| *Move the file* `samples/review/review.xml` to `src/main/resources/site/content-types/review/review.xml` in your project.
|2| *Optionally add icon* by moving the file `samples/review/review.svg` to `src/main/resources/site/content-types/review/review.svg` to get a nice icon in Content Studio.
|3| *Build and deploy* your application once more.
|4| *Write A review*. You should now be able to create a "Review" within Content Studio and the *HMDB* site.

image::images/review.png["Sample Review", width="687px"]
|============================


== Accessing the API

To access and browse the API, simply point your browser to: http://localhost:8080/site/hmdb/draft/hmdb/api

The API browser will now load, with the documentation immediately available on the right hand side.

image::images/playground.png["GraphQL Playground API browser", width="1052px"]

The API gives you read-access to all your content. Queries can now be typed into the left hand panel and executed, with the result in the right-hand panel.

NOTE: *New to GraphQL?* After completing the tutorial, check out the https://graphql.org[GraphQL documentation].


Below are a few examples of queries you can use to access the `HMDB` data.


== Sample queries

=== Persons

.Get the display name of five items from `persons/` folder:
[source,GraphQL]
----
{
 guillotine {
  getChildren(key:"${site}/persons" first:5){
    displayName
    _path
  	}
	}
}
----

NOTE: `${site}` is a placeholder for the path of the contextual site. In this case it expands to `/hmdb`

.Sample response:
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "getChildren": [
        {
          "displayName": "Brad Pitt",
          "_path": "/hmdb/persons/brad-pitt"
        },
        {
          "displayName": "Keanu Reeves ",
          "_path": "/hmdb/persons/keanu-reeves"
        },
        {
          "displayName": "Carrie-Anne Moss ",
          "_path": "/hmdb/persons/carrie-anne-moss"
        },
        {
          "displayName": "The Wachowskis",
          "_path": "/hmdb/persons/the-wachowskis"
        },
        {
          "displayName": "Bruce Willis",
          "_path": "/hmdb/persons/bruce-willis"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

=== Movies and cast

NOTE: Remember to replace `com.example.myproject` and `com_example_myproject` to match the name of your specific application (if you changed the project name during the project init).

.Get display name, and the cast of two movies:
[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  guillotine {
    query(query: "type='com.example.myproject:movie'", first: 2) {
      displayName
      ... on com_example_myproject_Movie {
        data {
          cast {
            actor {
              displayName
            }
            character
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

.Sample response
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "query": [
        {
          "displayName": "The Godfather",
          "data": {
            "cast": [
              {
                "actor": {
                  "displayName": "Al Pacino"
                },
                "character": " Michael Corleone"
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        {
          "displayName": "The Shawshank Redemption",
          "data": {
            "cast": [
              {
                "actor": {
                  "displayName": "Tim Robbins"
                },
                "character": "Andy Dufresne"
              },
              {
                "actor": {
                  "displayName": "Morgan Freeman"
                },
                "character": "Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding"
              },
              {
                "actor": {
                  "displayName": "Bob Gunton"
                },
                "character": "Warden Norton"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----


=== Person with photo

NOTE: Remember to replace `com.example.myproject` and `com_example_myproject` to match the name of your application

.Name of persons and a link to 400x400 scaled photo
[source,GraphQL]
----
{
  guillotine {
    query(query: "ngram('_allText', 'morgan') AND type='com.example.myproject:person'", first: 6) {
      displayName
      ... on com_example_myproject_Person {
    	  displayName
        data {
          photos(first:1){
            ... on media_Image {
              imageUrl(type:absolute scale:"block(400,400)")
            }

          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

.Sample response
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "query": [
        {
          "displayName": "Morgan Freeman",
          "data": {
            "photos": [
              {
                "imageUrl": "http://localhost:8080/site/default/draft/hmdb/_/image/7ab1f76a-69a1-490f-b505-6eb6773c7cec:603726cc4fa712aa1b70c7eb64e1349f664494c3/block-400-400/morgan-freeman.jpg"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

When deployed to production, all URLs will be aligned with the production domain.

== Creating a site from scratch

So far, we have used automatically imported content.
To create your own site and content, simply use Content Studio once more.

To create your own site:

[cols="1%s,99%a"]
[frame="none"]
[grid="none"]
|============================
|1| *Click btn:[New]* at a desired location in the structure, and choose the content type "Site".
|2| *Add your application to the site*

image::images/site.png["Add the application to your site", width="544"]

|3| Start creating content within the new site
|============================

TIP: You are completely free to group your content in folders and tree-structures, as well as setting permissions as you desire within the site, just like we do with `HMDB`.

== API setup

The `/api` endpoint is exposed through a controller mapping in the file `src/main/resources/site/site.xml`.
The controller uses underlying functionality provided through a library.
A dependency in the `build.gradle` file, located at your project root ensures that the library is downloaded and built into your app.

=== Customizing API

The Headless API is provided by the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/guillotine[Guillotine project].
You may programmatically customize or extend the GraphQL api, as described in the documentation above.

=== CORS headers

Sharing of resources across domains (origins) is known as https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS[CORS].
For security reasons, browsers will prevent POST requests from one domain to another by default.

GraphQL requests are normally POST requests, but our API is configured to allow traffic from any origin through the use of CORS headers.

If you want to limit access to a specific domains, or not at all, you may do so by customizing the controller file `src/main/resources/controllers/graphql.js`.


== Deploying to Production

To deploy your application to production, your first need a server running Enonic XP.

[NOTE]
====
If you don't already have a server, we recommend trying out https://developer.enonic.com/guides/xp-on-google-cloud-platform[Enonic XP on Google Cloud],
or request an instance from the https://enonic.com[Enonic Cloud]. If you are looking for other hosting options, Enonic XP is open source, and capable of running in any cloud or on premises.
====

With a running server, you may deploy your app by uploading it via the `Applications` admin tool.

After building/deploying an application locally, you will find the application file in your project's `build/libs/` folder. The file is typically called something like: `myproject-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.


== Creating a headless project without HMDB

The HMDB application is based on the https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/headless-cms-starter[Headless Starter]. 

To create a clean project directly from the headless starter, simply run the following command: 

  enonic project create -r starter-headless


Bon voyage!
